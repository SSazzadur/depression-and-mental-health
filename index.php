                    Here we are going to discuss about one of the most underrated topic of the society which is nothing
                    but
                    Depression & Mental Health. Nobody wants to share or discuss this topic even if they want to do so,
                    they
                    can’t as people in the society doesn’t give so much importance to it and many of them are unaware of
                    it.
                    It can happen to anyone from a billionaire to a farmer, from a Student to a labor. Everyone feels
                    down
                    at times. As example for a billionaire the loss in business might effect on the mental health,
                    causing
                    depression, likewise for a student bad grade, for a labor heavy workload & less salary, for a former
                    not
                    getting the proper price of his farming etc.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    There are many more example also in general like the breakup of a relationship can lead to low mood.
                    Death of a very close person can also effect on the mental health. Sometimes sadness comes on for no
                    apparent reason. Depression, versus ordinary unhappiness, is characterized by longer and deeper
                    feelings
                    of despondency and the presence of certain characteristic symptoms.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This distinction is important, because in severe cases, depression can be life threatening, with
                    suicide
                    as a possible outcome. Depressed people may also fail to live up to their potential, doing poorly in
                    school and staying on the social margins. Depression is frequently ignored or untreated; the
                    condition
                    often prevents people from taking steps to help themselves. This is unfortunate, as effective help
                    is
                    available. So we can say that depression leads to decrease the stability of the mental health
                    causing
                    guaranteed bad result.

                <h3>Identification of Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) explains some of the major symptoms of depression and

                <h3>Proposed Solutions</h3>
                <p>
                    When it comes to depression specifically, technology has lot of advantages.
                    Let's start with a morning conversation with a digital assistant like alexa or siri...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Me: Hi, Alexa. <br>
                    Alexa: Good morning, how are you?<br>
                    Me: I am fine, how are you? <br>
                    ...........................
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we can say that technology can help us to overcome the problem of depression.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <h3>Efficiency of Proposed Solutions</h3>
                <p>
                    Our key Proposed Solution are mainlky based upon technology those are building application,
                    developing devices using Artificial Intelligence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Proposed solution will solve the problems of mental illness for sure but there are yet few
                    rules which we have to follow. Otherwise it may come again...
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are: strict to your treatment plan, learn about depression, pay attention to warning signs,
                    avoid alcohol and drugs and take care of your body.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <h3>Impact of Proposed Solutions</h3>
                <p>
                    As per the Problem of 'Depression and Mental Health', the Technical Solutions Selected by i.e.,
                    building apps and using A.I. won't have any kind of impact on our Environment and Nature in nor
                    Positive way, neither Negative way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we knmow that that the works of a Computer Science Engineer is mainly executed on Computers,
                    Gadgets and Softwares, so there is no chance of any negative impact on our Environment and Nature.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <h3>Proposed Roadmap</h3>
                <p>
                    As we have sorted out the 2 solutions regarding the problem, 'Depression and Mental Health'. So
                    planning and execution Strategy of such solutions can be as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    a) Using Computer Languages we can build some apps where there is live interaction between the
                    individual and various Psychiatrists. <br>
                    b) Using Artificial Intelligence we can develop some devices which can be used to measure the level
                    of Stress, Anxiety, etc. via face expressions.

                        Here we are going to discuss about one of the most underrated topic of the society which is
                        nothing but Depression and Mental Health.
                        Basically we have created a website 'Depression and Mental Health'. It helps people to know
                        description of depression and mental health.
                        The main points to talk about Introduction, Case Study, Futurework and Conclusion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In our website we have created a Forum where people can interact with each other. When someone
                        post their problem others can come with the soltuion to the problem.
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        In future we are thinking to upgrade more features like audio call and video call facilities.
                        As well as we are also thinking of making a application along with this website which will be
                        made available in the playstore and can be download from it.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    At last, we can conclude that the Problem of “Depression and Mental Health” is one of the most
                    Common
                    and
                    Popular Problem, targeting mainly the Young Generation and also Peoples of various Age Groups of our
                    Society.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    As we know that Depression after all, leads to taking step in Suicide in most of the Cases, so to
                    tackle
                    it,
                    we have some Existing Solutions as well as some Technical Solutions which are provided by us.
                    Existing Solutions can be like Learning about Depression, Talking to Someone, keeping a Journal,
                    meditations
                    and Yogas, going for Exercises, avoiding Alcohols and Recreation drugs, eating a Balanced Diet,
                    setting
                    up
                    Goals, spent time Relaxing and many more.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    Other than these existing Solutions, we have some Technical Solutions which are like Building up
                    apps,
                    softwares, websites or Portals using Various Computer Languages like JAVA, C, C++, HTML etc.
                    And, also by using the Concept of A.I. (Artificial Intelligence), we can like build up a Gadget or
                    Sensor
                    which can measure or Calculate the Level of Stress or Anxiety of an individual as Already written in
                    the
                    Body.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    So, if we can Implement Such Technical Solutions to our Society, then less Percentage of People will
                    be
                    Depressed or Mentally Unbalanced.
                    So, at last we can say that “A Depressed-Free Society will always be Beneficial for the Whole
                    Nation”
